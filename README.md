## ⚛️ What is React?

**React** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It helps developers create fast, interactive UIs by dividing the UI into **reusable components**.

Key features of React:

- ✅ **Component-Based**: UI is split into independent, reusable components.
- ✅ **JSX Syntax**: Lets you write HTML in JavaScript.
- ✅ **Virtual DOM**: Efficient rendering by diffing virtual vs real DOM.
- ✅ **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows from parent to child.
- ✅ **React Hooks**: Use state and lifecycle without writing class components.

## 🧠 Core React Concepts (Summary)

| Concept        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `useState()`   | Adds state to functional components. |
| `useEffect()`  | Handles side-effects like fetching data, DOM updates. |
| `props`        | Short for “properties”; used to pass data between components. |
| `state`        | Internal component data that can change over time. |
| `JSX`          | JavaScript XML — lets you write HTML inside JS. |
| `Virtual DOM`  | React’s lightweight DOM copy used for efficient updates. |
| `React Router` | Library for handling multi-page routing in single-page apps. |
